# Pmaso

A collection of portfolio analysis tools. Generate custom investment portfolio class objects using
data collected from Yahoo Finance. See https://github.com/Jordan-M-Young/YAHOO-FINANCE-DWNLD to automatically
collect the requisite Yahoo Finance data.

Currently Pmaso allows one to initialize custom Portfolio class objects with a series of 
tickers representing the securities you wish to hold. 

Based on the principles of Modern Portfolio, Pmaso then optimizes the proportions
of your portfolio's component assets to lower risk and maximize returns.
