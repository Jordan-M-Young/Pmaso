# Port Maso

A collection of portfolio analysis tools. Generate custom investment portfolio class objects using
data collected from Yahoo Finance. See https://github.com/Jordan-M-Young/YAHOO-FINANCE-DWNLD to automatically
collect the requisite Yahoo Finance data.

Currently pyFolio allows one to initialize custom Portfolio class objects with a series of 
tickers representing the securities you wish to hold. You can generate a variety of parameters for individual
securities and an entire portfolio: betas, alphas, sharpe ratio, returns, and more. Enter different proportions
of each security in your portfolio to see how the relevant parameters change

pyFolio allows one to optimize held stock proportions(percentages) based on a given strategy, such as 
maximizing returns or minimizing beta.

Use the portfolio class and associated functions within your own scripts or analyze your portfolios using 
the pyFolio app.
