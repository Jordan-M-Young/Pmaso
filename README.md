# pyFolio

A collection of portfolio analysis tools. Generate custom investment portfolio class objects using
data collected from Yahoo Finance. See https://github.com/Jordan-M-Young/YAHOO-FINANCE-DWNLD to automatically
collect the requisite Yahoo Finance data.

Currently pyFolio allows one to initialize custom Portfolio class objects with a series of 
tickers representing the securities you wish to hold. You can generate covariance of a security to an index,
security betas, portfolio betas, security alphas, and portfolio alphas. 

pyFolio is being constructed on top of numpy, pandas, scipy, sci-kit learn, and matplotlib. As such there will
be great functionality in terms of statistical analysis and optimization of your portfolios in the near future.
